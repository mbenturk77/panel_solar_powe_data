# panel_solar_powe_data
The goal is predict the power output for a particular array of solar power generators, knowing some environmental conditions.
the following variables for this analysis:
  distance-to-solar-noon, in radians.
  temperature, daily average temperature, in degrees Celsius.
  wind-direction, daily average wind direction, in degrees (0-360).
  wind-speed, daily average wind speed, in meters per second.
  sky-cover, in a five-step scale, from 0 to 4, being 0 totally clear and 4 completely covered.
  visibility, in kilometers.
  humidity, in percentage.
  average-wind-speed-(period), average wind speed during the 3-hour period de measure was taken in, in meters per second.
  average-pressure-(period), average barometric pressure during the 3-hour period de measure was taken in, in mercury inches.
  power-generated, in jules for each 3-hour period.
power_generated is target variable.
 data cleaned, missing values find and visually and statistically analyzed.
 by using Neural network power generation was predicted.
